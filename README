Before ruan this code, here are the softwares and packages that required:
  1. bedtools
  2. pandas
  
 Here is how to run the code:
 step 1: generating the intersect bed file
 bedtools intersect -b motif_coord.bed -a window_coord.bed -wb -wa >intersect.bed
 
 Motif_coord.bed: the motif coordinates. When you analyze other features, you can replace the motif coordinate files with other epigenomic features or transposable elements
 Window_coord.bed: the coordinates of windows. In our analysis, the windows are 50kb resolution. You can replace it with your window coordinates.
 intersect.bed: the output file
 
 Step 2: generate features:
 python getTF_windows.py intersect.bed window_coord.bed >dataset.motif.csv
 
dataset.motif.csv is the output file
